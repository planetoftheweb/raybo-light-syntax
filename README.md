# Raybo Light Syntax theme

When I used Sublime Text, I had my own version of the [solarized] theme because I wanted to improve on it's contrast a bit and add some markdown features. I wanted to duplicate that in Atom, so I'm starting with the solarized theme and tweaking from there. It's not going to be drastically different.
